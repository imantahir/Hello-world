# Hello-world I am 18 years and currently in my second year of college at ivytech. My major is informatics and i chose this because jobs pay top rate ad i didn't find the major very difficult plus i was really interested in pursuing it because of all the career options i have available includig working in the health indutrsy department of techonolgy or cybersecurity.Aside from my life of studying i happen to take an interest in many other hobbies such as various sports, i have a love for the outdoors going into the nature and exploring wildlife and also creating pottery, carving wood structures, painting and music.
